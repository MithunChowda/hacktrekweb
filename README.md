# _**THIS PARTICULAR SITE IS ONLY MADE FOR WINDOWS**_











# Vulnerability Check Site

## Overview

Welcome to the **Vulnerability Check Site**, a deliberately insecure web application designed for developers, security professionals, and ethical hackers. This project offers a hands-on learning experience by helping you identify, exploit, and patch common web application vulnerabilities. Modeled after **Juice Shop**, this app provides various security challenges that will test your skills in areas like authentication, authorization, input validation, and more.

Whether you're new to web security or looking to refine your skills, this site serves as an ideal environment for experimenting with common security flaws and learning how to fix them.





## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to provide an educational and engaging platform where users can:
- üîç Learn about common web application vulnerabilities.
- üíª Gain practical experience in ethical hacking.
- üõ°Ô∏è Understand how to mitigate security flaws in real-world web applications.


## Prerequisites

### Operating System:


#### Windows:
- **Visual Studio**: For running and developing the app.
- Web request analysis tools similar to **Burp Suite**:
  1. **ZapProxy**: An easy-to-use proxy for intercepting web traffic.
  2. **Intruder**: For advanced web application attacks.
  3. **MITMProxy**: A powerful tool for analyzing HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
- **XAMPP**: For backend services like Apache and MySQL.



## Installation Steps

### Set up the environment:

#### For Windows:

1. Install **Visual Studio** (if not already installed).
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the app using the following command:

       npm run dev


4. Explore the website and identify vulnerabilities to learn and improve your hacking skills!

To install **React** and manage routing, run:


    npm install react-router-dom


## Back End Setup

### XAMPP:

1. Open the **XAMPP** application.
2. Start the following backend services:
   - **Apache**: The web server.
   - **MySQL**: The database server.


## Explore and Learn

Dive into the application to discover vulnerabilities such as:
- **Authentication Bypass** üîê: Test the security of login mechanisms.
- **SQL Injection** üß†: Inject malicious SQL queries to access or manipulate the database.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** üí•: Inject scripts to manipulate the client's browser and steal data.
- **Chatbot Challenge** ü§ñ: Explore vulnerabilities within the chatbot system and test your skills in exploiting it.


## Secure Coding Practices

As you identify vulnerabilities, this project will teach you how to **patch** them:
- **Input Validation**: Learn the importance of properly sanitizing inputs to prevent injections and XSS.
- **Access Control**: Ensure that users can only access data they are authorized to view.
- **Session Management**: Understand how to securely handle sessions to prevent attacks like session hijacking.
- **Cryptography**: Explore basic concepts of encrypting sensitive data like passwords.


## Tools for Security Testing

Here are some of the tools you can use to explore the vulnerabilities in this project:

- **Burp Suite**: For web vulnerability scanning and traffic interception.
- **OWASP ZAP**: An open-source security tool for finding vulnerabilities.
- **Nikto**: A web server scanner that identifies vulnerabilities.
- **SQLMap**: An automated tool for detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Wireshark**: For capturing and analyzing network traffic.

These tools will help you identify, exploit, and secure vulnerabilities in the app, providing a hands-on learning experience.
