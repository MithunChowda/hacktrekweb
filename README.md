## Objective

This project is a deliberately insecure web application designed to help developers, security professionals, and ethical hackers learn how to identify, exploit, and fix common web application vulnerabilities. It is modeled after Juice Shop, a popular vulnerable web application, and provides a range of security challenges to test various aspects of web security, including authentication, authorization, input validation, and more.

## Prerequisites

## Operating System:
### kali linux:
- burp suit.

### WINDOWS:

- visual studios
- webrequest websites like burp suit for windows:
1. ZapProxy
2. intruder
3. MITMproxy
- xamp

# Installation Steps

## Set up the environment:

### For Windows:

1.install the required software ,Which is visuall studios

2.move to the project directory 

3.run the app using the "npm run dev" in the terminal
as the app is runnting using react mae sure that the needed vite+ts and react is installed in the pc

explore the website and find out the vulnurabilities on your own to make it more intresting

Install react:

    npm install react-router-dom

### FOR LINUX 

CLONE THE REPOSITORY:
   
    git clone https://github.com/MithunChowda/hacktrekweb
now change the directory to where the app is located and run it using burp suit as it is required in the furthur steps

# Back end

## XAMP
open the xamp app and run the backend which is the **apache** and **MYSQL**



check out the vulnurabilities to learn how to bypass them ;)
